Player: These Imperial bastards are getting too close for comfort, Gervan. I don’t like the fact we haven’t heard from Ulfric since he left for Solitude. Me: He is our True High King, Valerius. A proud and fierce warrior. He cannot be defeated by that so called "king" filling his days sitting a throne and writing amendments. <EOL>

Player: Besides, our army is far superior. Most of their soldiers are from Cyrodiil. They do not know these lands like we do; we are Nords, by Talos, born and raised in this land. We will not lose this war. <EOL>

Me: I hope so my friend...Toryyg is indeed no match for our great Jarl, but his guards aren’t just mercenaries with a poking stick either. They may not know Skyrim like we do, but they’re still a force to be reckoned with. <|endoftext|>
